### Project Euler in Haskell

I am solving [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems in Haskell as
a way to learn more Haskell and become a better problem solver. My goal is to
have every solution produce the correct answer in under 30 seconds.

Many of my solutions are not as optimal as the [official Haskell
solutions](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Euler_problems), but I am doing
them without any assistance, so that is expected. Hopefully my solutions will
become increasingly refined as I (a) become more comfortable with Haskell and (b) get better at problem solving.
